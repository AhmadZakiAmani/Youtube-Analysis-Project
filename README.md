# Youtube-Analysis-Project
A custom YouTube analysis dashboard built with Power BI to monitor and compare the performance of multiple channels. This project utilizes Power Query (M) to connect to the YouTube Data API, creating a solution for side-by-side creator analysis that is not available on the native YouTube platform.
